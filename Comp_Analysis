Seems very responsive, and I get my resolution quickly.Swiggy is a good platform for online food ordering and delivery from a variety of local restaurants. Swiggy offers a variety of features; the quality of food, packing, delivery time, and pricing are competitive and reasonably good. The app is user-friendly favoring the ease of use and implementation. Customer support is friendly and helpful.

From the moment I walked in, the ambiance was far from inviting â€“ dimly lit, tacky decor, and an overall lack of cleanliness. The menu boasted a variety of dishes, but the taste failed to live up to the expectations set by the descriptions. I ordered the supposedly  signature dish, only to be met with a bland and uninspired concoction that lacked any distinct flavors. The service was equally dismal, with the staff displaying a complete lack of enthusiasm and attentiveness. To make matters worse, the portion sizes were laughably small, leaving me hungry and dissatisfied. I can confidently say that my visit to this establishment was a regrettable waste of time and money. Save yourself the trouble and opt for a more deserving dining experience elsewhere")
